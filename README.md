# System Watchdog & GUI Dashboard

A dual-layer system monitoring solution for Linux. It combines a robust Bash Daemon that runs in the background to monitor system health with a modern PyQt6 Dashboard for real-time control and visualization.

## Features

## The GUI Dashboard (PyQt6)

Control Center: Start and stop the background daemon with a single click.

Live Logging: View real-time system logs (simulates tail -f) directly in the app.

Status Indicator: Visual feedback (Running/Stopped) checking the actual PID.

Hot-Swap Config: Adjust CPU and Disk thresholds instantly without restarting the script.

## The Background Daemon (Bash)

Silent Operation: Runs as a background process using PID file management.

Resource Monitoring: Checks CPU usage (via top) and Disk space (via df).

Desktop Alerts: Sends native system notifications (via libnotify) when thresholds are crossed.

Safety: Implements signal trapping (SIGINT, SIGTERM) to clean up resources upon exit.

## Prerequisites

System: Linux (Arch, Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc.)

Python: Python 3.x

Libraries: libnotify (for system alerts)

Python Packages: PyQt6

## Installation & Usage

Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/system-watchdog.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/system-watchdog.git)
cd system-watchdog


Install Python Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


Make the Daemon Executable

chmod +x watchdog_v2.sh


Run the Dashboard

python dashboard.py

How to Use

Start: Click the green Start Daemon button. The status indicator will turn GREEN.

Configure: Enter your desired thresholds (e.g., 80 for CPU) and click Save Config. The daemon will pick up these changes automatically on its next check cycle.

Monitor: Watch the "Live System Logs" panel for activity and alerts.

Stop: Click Stop Daemon to safely kill the background process.

File Structure

dashboard.py: The main GUI application.

watchdog_v2.sh: The core logic script (the daemon).

watchdog.conf: Configuration file generated by the GUI.

requirements.txt: Python dependency list.
